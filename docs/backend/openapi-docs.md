# OpenAPI Docs

`@cornie-js/api-openapi-schema` package includes the OpenAPI docs of the REST API.

In addition, there's a docker service provided for development purposes that launch a Swagger UI server rendering those docs.

To launch the service, simply launch the `serve:api:rest:docs` npm script:

`pnpm run serve:api:rest:docs`
